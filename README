Welcome to the comma.ai 2017 Programming Challenge!

Basically, your goal is to predict the speed of a car from a video.

data/train.mp4 is a video of driving containing 20400 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
data/train.txt contains the speed of the car at each frame, one speed on each line.

data/test.mp4 is a different driving video containing 10798 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
Your deliverable is test.txt

We will evaluate your test.txt using mean squared error. <10 is good. <5 is better. <3 is heart.





IMPORTANT

Deliverable test.txt is already in the current folder, to run the code, open main.ipynb run from block to block, then place train and test video file under data folder. 

total runtime is around 30 minutes on my laptop(should be a lot faster with cuda enabled Nvidia computer
